source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Run the Scraper
```bash
# Basic usage (default: "PSA 10 Pokemon Card", 5 pages)

  "price": 140.0,
  "listing_url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/...",
  "image_urls": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/.../s-l500.jpg"],
  "images": [{"url": "...", "path": "ebay/PSA/2018_POKEMON_SUN_&_MOON_LOST_THUNDER_#121_TYRANITAR_GX_20251023_140329.jpg"}],

### Performance

- **Speed**: ~250 items in 10 minutes (~25 items/min)
- **Success Rate**: Successfully bypasses eBay bot detection
- **Image Downloads**: Concurrent downloads with organized storage

### Anti-Bot Detection Features

The scraper includes several measures to avoid detection:
- Custom Chrome 120 user agent
- 1920x1080 viewport
- Disabled automation flags
- Navigator.webdriver property override
- Randomized download delays (2s average)

### Advanced Usage

#### Adjust Download Speed
Edit `graded_cards_scraper/settings.py`:
```python
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 2  # Seconds between requests
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 8  # Total concurrent requests
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN = 4  # Per domain
```

#### Change Image Storage Location
Edit `graded_cards_scraper/settings.py`:
```python
IMAGES_STORE = '/custom/path/to/images'
```

#### Adjust Image Quality for AI Training
Edit `graded_cards_scraper/settings.py`:
```python
# Increase minimum dimensions for higher quality dataset
IMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT = 800  # Default: 400
IMAGES_MIN_WIDTH = 800   # Default: 400

# Adjust download timeout for large high-res images
DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 60  # Default: 30
```

See [HIGH_RESOLUTION_IMAGES.md](HIGH_RESOLUTION_IMAGES.md) for detailed information about image quality optimization for AI training.

#### Enable/Disable Headless Mode
Edit `graded_cards_scraper/settings.py`:
```python
PLAYWRIGHT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
    "headless": False,  # Set to False to see browser
    "args": [
        "--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled",
    ],
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Images Not Downloading
- Check `downloaded_images/` folder exists
- Verify `allowed_domains` includes `ebayimg.com` in spider
- Check pipeline is enabled in settings

#### Bot Detection / Challenge Pages
- Increase `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in settings
- Check user agent is up to date
- Verify anti-automation flags are set

#### No Items Scraped
- Check eBay page structure hasn't changed
- Verify selectors in `ebay_spider.py`:
  - Items: `ul.srp-results li`
  - Title: `img::attr(alt)`
  - Price: `*::text` with regex `r'\$[\d,]+\.?\d*'`
  - URL: `a.image-treatment::attr(href)`

### Example Queries

```bash
# PSA 10 Pikachu cards
scrapy crawl ebay_graded_cards -a search_query="Pikachu PSA 10" -O pikachu.json

# Vintage cards
scrapy crawl ebay_graded_cards -a search_query="Pokemon Base Set PSA 10" -O vintage.json

# High-value cards
scrapy crawl ebay_graded_cards -a search_query="Pokemon PSA 10 1st Edition" -O first_edition.json

# BGS graded cards
scrapy crawl ebay_graded_cards -a search_query="Pokemon BGS 10" -O bgs_10.json
```

### Data Analysis

#### Image Quality Analysis (For AI Training)

After scraping, analyze image quality:
```bash
# Analyze all downloaded images
python analyze_image_quality.py

# Analyze specific directory
python analyze_image_quality.py downloaded_images/ebay/PSA
```

This will show:
- Total images and quality distribution
- Average dimensions by source and grading company
- AI training readiness assessment
- Recommendations for filter adjustments

#### JSON Data Analysis

View scraped data:
```bash
# Pretty print first 5 items
python3 -c "import json; data=json.load(open('output.json')); print(json.dumps(data[:5], indent=2))"

# Count items by grading company
python3 -c "import json; from collections import Counter; data=json.load(open('output.json')); print(Counter(item['grading_company'] for item in data))"

# Average price by grade
python3 -c "import json; from statistics import mean; data=json.load(open('output.json')); grades={}; [grades.setdefault(item['grade'], []).append(item['price']) for item in data if item.get('price')]; print({g:mean(prices) for g, prices in grades.items()})"
```

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Card Name Parsing**: Some titles don't have clear card names (returns empty string)
   - These items still have full title and other data
   - Can be parsed manually or with improved regex

2. **Price Variations**: Some listings show price ranges (e.g., "$100 to $500")
   - Currently extracts first price found
   - Consider updating regex to handle ranges

3. **Rate Limiting**: eBay may throttle after extended scraping
   - Increase delays if you see challenges
   - Consider using rotating proxies for large-scale scraping


### CSV Conversion

Convert JSON output to Excel/CSV format with statistics:

```bash
# Automatic conversion (recommended)
scrapy crawl ebay_graded_cards -O pokemon.json
python3 convert_to_csv.py pokemon.json --with-stats

# Manual conversion
python3 convert_to_csv.py output.json

# Batch convert multiple files
python3 convert_to_csv.py --batch scraped_data/

# Merge multiple CSV files
python3 convert_to_csv.py --merge file1.csv file2.csv -o combined.csv
```

### Example Statistics Output

```
Total Items Scraped: 255
Average Price: $378.26
Median Price: $250.00
Total Value: $96,456.69

Items by Grading Company:
  PSA: 248
  CGC: 4

Top Card: $4,799.00 - 2016 Pokemon Charizard EX (PSA 10)
```

```

### Using the Utils Package

The utility functions are now organized in a dedicated `utils/` package for better code organization:

```python
# Import from the utils package directly
from utils.analyze_image_quality import analyze_image_quality, print_statistics
from utils.convert_to_csv import json_to_csv, batch_json_to_csv

# Or use the CLI wrappers
# python analyze_image_quality.py downloaded_images/
# python convert_to_csv.py output.json --with-stats
```

For backward compatibility, the functions are also available through `graded_cards_scraper.utils`:
```python
from graded_cards_scraper.utils import json_to_csv  # Still works!
```

## Configuration

Edit `graded_cards_scraper/settings.py` to customize:

- `DOWNLOAD_DELAY`: Delay between requests (default: 2 seconds)
- `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`: Number of concurrent requests (default: 8)
- `IMAGES_STORE`: Directory for downloaded images
- `PLAYWRIGHT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS`: Browser settings (headless mode, etc.)

## Data Fields

Each scraped item includes:

- `card_name`: Name of the Pokemon card
- `card_number`: Card number (if available)
- `set_name`: Pokemon set name (if available)
- `grading_company`: Grading company (PSA, BGS, CGC, etc.)
- `grade`: Card grade (e.g., 10, 9.5)
- `title`: Full listing title
- `price`: Listing price
- `currency`: Currency (USD)
- `source`: 'ebay' or 'mercari'
- `listing_url`: URL to the listing
- `image_urls`: List of image URLs
- `images`: List of downloaded image paths
- `scraped_date`: Timestamp of when the data was scraped

## Tips

1. **Respect Rate Limits**: The scraper includes delays and auto-throttle to avoid overwhelming servers
2. **Custom Searches**: Use specific search queries for better results (e.g., "PSA 10 Base Set Charizard")
3. **Image Storage**: Images are organized by source/grading_company/card_name in the `downloaded_images` folder
4. **Debugging**: Remove `headless: True` in settings.py to see the browser in action

## Troubleshooting

- **No items scraped**: Check if the website structure has changed or increase wait times in Playwright
- **Playwright errors**: Ensure browsers are installed with `playwright install chromium`
- **Rate limiting**: Increase `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in settings.py
