# Troubleshooting Guide - No Data Being Scraped

## Problem
The scraper runs but no images are being downloaded and saved.

## Root Cause
Based on testing, the issue is **network connectivity/timeout** when trying to access eBay. The connection times out before eBay responds.

## Possible Reasons

###  1. eBay is Blocking Automated Requests
eBay has sophisticated bot detection and may be blocking requests from:
- Python's `requests` library
- Known datacenter IPs
- Requests without proper browser signatures

### 2. Network/Firewall Issues
- Corporate firewall blocking eBay
- ISP blocking or rate-limiting
- Network connectivity issues
- VPN/proxy interference

### 3. eBay's HTML Structure Changed
- Sel

ectors in the scraper may be outdated
- eBay uses different HTML for different regions/users

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Selenium-Based Scraper (RECOMMENDED)

Selenium uses a real browser, making it much harder for eBay to detect automation.

**Install ChromeDriver:**
```bash
# On macOS
brew install --cask google-chrome
brew install chromedriver

# On other systems, download from:
# https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
```

**Use the Selenium scraper:**
```bash
python scraper_selenium.py
```

Or in Python:
```python
from scraper_selenium import EbaySeleniumScraper

scraper = EbaySeleniumScraper(headless=False)  # Set headless=True to hide browser
try:
    count = scraper.search_graded_cards(
        grading_company='PSA',
        grade=10,
        max_results=10
    )
    print(f"Downloaded {count} images")
finally:
    scraper.close()
```

### Solution 2: Use a VPN

If eBay is blocking your IP or region:
```bash
# Connect to a VPN, then try scraping again
python debug_scraper.py
```

### Solution 3: Use eBay's Official API (Best for Production)

For reliable, legal scraping:

1. Sign up for eBay Developer account: https://developer.ebay.com/
2. Get API credentials
3. Use the Finding API or Browse API
4. No risk of being blocked

**Pros:**
- Legal and supported
- Reliable
- More data available
- No blocking

**Cons:**
- Requires API key
- Rate limits apply
- More complex setup

### Solution 4: Increase Timeouts and Add Delays

Already done in `config.py`, but you can increase further:

```python
# In config.py
TIMEOUT = 120  # 2 minutes
REQUEST_DELAY_MIN = 5
REQUEST_DELAY_MAX = 10
```

### Solution 5: Test Connection Manually

```bash
# Test if you can access eBay
python debug_scraper.py

# This will:
# 1. Test basic connection
# 2. Try to fetch a search page
# 3. Save HTML to debug_search_page.html
# 4. Show what's being found/blocked
```

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Test Your Connection
```bash
python debug_scraper.py
```

Look for:
- ✓ Connection successful = Network OK
- ✗ Connection timed out = Network/blocking issue

### Step 2: Check If eBay Is Accessible
Open your browser and go to:
```
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pokemon+PSA+10
```

If this works in browser but not in scraper = eBay is blocking automated requests

### Step 3: Try Selenium Scraper
```bash
python scraper_selenium.py
```

If this works = eBay was blocking simple HTTP requests

### Step 4: Check the HTML
If `debug_search_page.html` was created, open it and check:
- Are there search results?
- Is there a CAPTCHA?
- Is there a "blocked" message?

## Current Status

Based on your test, the scraper is experiencing:
```
✗ Connection failed: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ebay.com', port=443): Read timed out
```

This means the connection to eBay is timing out before getting a response.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try Selenium scraper** (most likely to work):
   ```bash
   python scraper_selenium.py
   ```

2. **If still failing, test basic connection**:
   ```bash
   curl https://www.ebay.com
   # Or
   python debug_scraper.py
   ```

3. **Consider eBay API** for production use

4. **Use VPN** if your IP/region is blocked

## Alternative: Use eBay Finding API

Example with official API:
```python
from ebaysdk.finding import Connection

api = Connection(appid='YOUR_APP_ID', config_file=None)
response = api.execute('findItemsAdvanced', {
    'keywords': 'pokemon PSA 10'
})

for item in response.dict()['searchResult']['item']:
    print(item['title'])
    print(item['galleryURL'])
```

This requires:
```bash
pip install ebaysdk
```

And an API key from https://developer.ebay.com/

## Summary

**The scraper code is correct**, but eBay is blocking or timing out connections. The best solution is to:

1. Use the Selenium-based scraper (`scraper_selenium.py`)
2. Or use eBay's official API
3. Ensure you have good network connectivity
