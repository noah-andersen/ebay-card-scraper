# Repository Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored and consolidated the ebay-card-scraper repository into a modular, multi-marketplace scraping system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Modular Architecture

**New Directory Structure:**
```
scrapers/
├── __init__.py           # Package initialization
├── base_scraper.py       # Abstract base class with common functionality
├── ebay_scraper.py       # eBay marketplace implementation
└── mercari_scraper.py    # Mercari marketplace implementation
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to add new marketplaces
- Shared functionality (image download, metadata management, logging)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent interface across marketplaces

### 2. Base Scraper Class (`base_scraper.py`)

**Features:**
- Abstract base class for all marketplace scrapers
- Common functionality extracted:
  - Image downloading with PIL
  - Metadata management (CSV storage)
  - Filename sanitization
  - Logging setup per marketplace
  - User agent rotation
- Enforces consistent interface via abstract methods

### 3. eBay Scraper (`ebay_scraper.py`)

**Refactored from old `scraper.py`:**
- Inherits from BaseScraper
- eBay-specific URL building
- eBay listing extraction logic
- Support for sold listings
- Pagination handling
- Built-in debugging (saves HTML on issues)

### 4. Mercari Scraper (`mercari_scraper.py`)

**New Implementation:**
- Built following BaseScraper pattern
- Mercari-specific search URL construction
- Multiple selector strategies for robustness
- Price extraction from Mercari listings
- Image URL extraction
- Complete metadata tracking

### 5. Updated CLI (`main.py`)

**New Features:**
- Multi-marketplace support
- `--marketplace` flag: ebay, mercari, or both
- Unified interface across marketplaces
- Progress tracking per marketplace
- Total count across all marketplaces

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Single marketplace
python main.py --marketplace ebay --company PSA --grade 10 --max-results 50

# Multiple marketplaces
python main.py --marketplace both --company BGS --grade 9.5 --max-results 30

# Specific card
python main.py --marketplace mercari --company PSA --grade 10 --card-name Charizard --max-results 20
```

### 6. Updated Documentation

**README.md:**
- Updated to reflect multi-marketplace support
- New usage examples for both CLI and Python API
- Architecture documentation
- Guide for adding new marketplaces

**QUICKSTART.md:**
- Quick start guide for new users
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common use cases

**TROUBLESHOOTING.md:**
- Marketplace-specific issues
- Connection problems
- Debug strategies

### 7. Example Scripts (`examples.py`)

**Interactive Examples:**
1. Single marketplace scraping
2. Multiple marketplace scraping
3. Specific card search
4. Sold listings (eBay)
5. Custom output directories
6. Programmatic grade iteration

### 8. Files Removed

**Cleaned up scattered files:**
- ✓ `debug_scraper.py` - Removed (debug functionality in base class)
- ✓ `scraper_selenium.py` - Removed (can be added back if needed)
- ✓ `example.py` - Removed (replaced by examples.py)
- ✓ `scraper.py` - Removed (refactored to scrapers/ebay_scraper.py)
- ✓ `utils.py` - Removed (functionality moved to BaseScraper)

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Modularity
- Each marketplace is independent
- Shared code in base class
- Easy to test individually

### 2. Extensibility
- Add new marketplaces by extending BaseScraper
- Minimal code duplication
- Clear template to follow

### 3. Maintainability
- Single source of truth for common logic
- Changes to base class benefit all scrapers
- Clear separation of marketplace-specific code

### 4. Consistency
- Same interface for all marketplaces
- Consistent metadata format
- Unified logging and error handling

## Testing the Changes

### Test Individual Scraper:
```python
from scrapers import EbayScraper

scraper = EbayScraper()
count = scraper.search_graded_cards('PSA', 10, max_results=5)
print(f"Downloaded {count} images")
```

### Test CLI:
```bash
python main.py --marketplace ebay --company PSA --grade 10 --max-results 5
```

### Test Examples:
```bash
python examples.py
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test eBay scraper functionality
2. Test Mercari scraper functionality
3. Verify metadata CSV generation
4. Check image downloads work correctly

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add TCGPlayer marketplace
2. Add support for other TCGs (Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic)
3. Implement Selenium-based fallback for blocked requests
4. Add image quality filtering
5. Implement duplicate detection across marketplaces
6. Add database storage option
7. Create price trend analysis

## Known Limitations

### eBay:
- May have connection issues due to bot detection
- Sophisticated anti-scraping measures
- Consider using Selenium for more reliable results
- Official API recommended for production use

### Mercari:
- New implementation - needs testing
- May require adjustments based on actual page structure
- Rate limiting important to avoid blocks

## Configuration

All scrapers share common configuration in `config.py`:
- Request timeouts (60s default)
- Delays between requests (3-7s random)
- Image format and quality
- Output directories
- Grading companies supported

## Summary

✅ **Successfully consolidated repository**
✅ **Created modular, extensible architecture**
✅ **Implemented two marketplace scrapers**
✅ **Updated all documentation**
✅ **Cleaned up scattered files**
✅ **Created comprehensive examples**

The repository is now well-organized, maintainable, and ready for adding additional marketplaces!
